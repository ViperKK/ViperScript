# ViperScript
Official programming language of Viper: ViperScript/Viper. It is a cross between Python and JavaScript. In its infancy.
Old versions are archived, all the way down to the first version with only the print and input (ask) commands.
## How did you make it?
Using Google Blockly and OnlineGDB, I made a programming language based on Python. Pretty simple at the time.
## Can I help?
Sure! I need criticism anyway.
