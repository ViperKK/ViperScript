# ViperScript
Official programming language of Viper: ViperScript/Viper. ~~It is a cross between Python and JavaScript. In its infancy.~~ It's whatever it wants to be.
Old versions are archived, all the way down to the first version with only the print and input (ask) commands.
## Disclaimer
~~Due to me being pretty new at programming (This is mostly a hobby project, no need to talk to me about how this is apparently a bad idea), this should be used *in conjunction* with Python syntax.~~ It's finally becoming a real man.
~~## This is really, really confusing.
I know, I probably made the math stuff way too hard. No worries, I have a wiki.~~
## How did you make it?
Using Google Blockly and ~~OnlineGDB~~ [this template on Replit](https://replit.com/talk/templates/Programming-Language-Template/33930), I made a programming language based on ~~Python.~~ JavaScript. Pretty simple.
## Can I help?
Sure! I need criticism anyway.
