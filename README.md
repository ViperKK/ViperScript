# ViperScript
Official programming language of Viper: ViperScript/Viper. It is a cross between Python and JavaScript. In its infancy.
Old versions are archived, all the way down to the first version with only the print and input (ask) commands.
## Disclaimer
Due to me being pretty new at programming (This is mostly a hobby project), this should be used *in conjunction* with Python syntax.
## How did you make it?
Using Google Blockly and OnlineGDB, I made a programming language based on Python. Pretty simple... well now it has more useful stuff.
## Can I help?
Sure! I need criticism anyway.
